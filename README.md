# UK-University-Recommender

This project aims to recommend one of the top 20 universities in the UK using a Machine Learning model (Multi-class Logisitic Regression).
The model has been trained on on over 3000 individual ratings of universities from students from from Whatuni.com, scraped in February 2021.
The final web application/tool asks users to think about their anticipated major and the key features they are looking for in a university. They are ultimately asked to input this major and to rank statements about the importance of job prospects, university facilities, university lectures, university societies and sports, and university local life on a scale of 1-5 in order of relative importance.
